Hi! 你好！Welcome to my personal website. I am a Ph.D. Candidate <br />
in the Department of Government and Politics at the University of <br />
Maryland, College Park. My subfields are International Relations <br />
and American Politics. I study U.S. Congress, U.S.-China relations,<br />
and U.S. foreign policy. I am also interested in research methods in<br />
social sciences, especially the graphical models for causal inference. <br />
Before joining the University of Maryland, I worked as an Assistant <br />
Research Fellow at the National Institute for South China Sea Studies <br />
(NISCSS) in Hainan, China.
