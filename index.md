Hi! 你好！Welcome to my personal website. I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Government and Politics at the University of Maryland, College Park. I study U.S. Congress, U.S.-China relations, and U.S. foreign policy. Before joining the University of Maryland, I worked as an Assistant Research Fellow at the National Institute for South China Sea Studies (NISCSS) in Hainan, China.
